* contour lines as darken or similar.
* review landcover-flat, make it terrain aware again
* simplify coastline for ZL <= 6
* calculate casing colors so they're not calculated all the time
* thicker for phone?
* lowzooms: specific rivers/lakes for rendering
  * natural earth vs imagico
* sync riverbanks thickness with river casing
* find out city pattern in old maps, apply to populated places.
* farmland, vineyeard, orchard
* intermittent waterways too prominent, make casing intermittent too
* borders for lakes in z0-z8
* pines grow up to 5000m. check terrain colors against forest or similar.

* fix roads as line too dark: DONE?

* review names for stupid things like picnic_table
* partially revert b066af54f61b02685edb5db4191c5fbc3617eb5d
* comment more the tags that are removed so I can resolve conflicts more easily

* less prominent place names halos.
  * no way, no halo opacity.
