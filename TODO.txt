* ZL 8
* ocean
* contours
*
* finish places texts
* fix tunnel road names
* vallons/bois names too prominent.
* contour lines as darken or similar.
* review landcover-flat, make it terrain aware again
* simplify coastline for ZL <= 6
* calculate casing colors so they're not calculated all the time
* thicker for phone?
* lowzooms: specific rivers/lakes for rendering
  * natural earth vs imagico
* sync riverbanks thickness with river casing
* find out city pattern in old maps, apply to populated places.
* farmland, vineyeard, orchard
* intermittent waterways too prominent, make casing intermittent too
* borders for lakes in z0-z8
* pines grow up to 5000m. check terrain colors against forest or similar.

* fix roads as line too dark: DONE? Nope ZL12
 * ZL12, make tertiary more prominent by just enthicken the line, no white center
 * ZL13-14: residential, etc are still lines, if possible less prominent

* review names for stupid things like picnic_table
* partially revert b066af54f61b02685edb5db4191c5fbc3617eb5d
* comment more the tags that are removed so I can resolve conflicts more easily
