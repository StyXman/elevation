This are some symbols taken from the pre-rendered icons from the maki-1.x series[1].
Their license is not clear, but the original icons were CC0 at the moment of their
rendering, so I assume the renderings are too. Their date of checkout is unknown,
but somewhere around 2014 or 2015.

[1] Technically, the 0.5 series; there was never a 1.x tag, and on March 29th, 2016
the 2.x series started by replacing everything.
